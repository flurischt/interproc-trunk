  abstract =     {We propose a new approach to interprocedural
                  analysis/verification, consisting in deriving an
                  interprocedural analysis method by abstract interpretation of
                  the standard operational semantics of programs.  The
                  advantages of this approach are twofold. From a
                  methodological point of view, it provides a direct connection
                  between the concrete semantics of the program and the
                  effective analysis, which facilitates implementation and
                  correction proofs.  This method also integrates two main,
                  distinct methods for interprocedural analysis, namely the
                  call-string and the functional approaches introduced by
                  Sharir and Pnueli. This enables strictly more precise
                  analyses and additional flexibility in the tradeoff between
                  efficiency and precision of the analysis.}
